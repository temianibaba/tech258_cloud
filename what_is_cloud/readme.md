# Cloud Computing
## What is cloud computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of IT resources using the internet, instead of using physical data centers, cloud computing allows users to access technology such as computer power, storage and databases whenever wherever you want to.

## How do we know if something is in the cloud?
If you can access the same software from different devices then that software is probably saved to the cloud.<br>
**On premises**<br>
Being on premises refers to a software being hosted on your own/rented hardware. It is not remote, you have to be near the hardware to access the software. That is the main difference between the cloud and on premises, one is remote whilst the other isn't.
## 4 Deployment methods
### Private

One to one environment for a single user, hardware is not shared with anyone else but you! This deployment method allows you to access software within an outlined border, most private clouds are secured with a firewall and kept under supervision. Has the highest flexibility of control out of the 4 deployment methods, however is less scalable, and costs more.
### Public
